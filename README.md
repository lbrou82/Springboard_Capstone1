# Springboard_Capstone_1

**Description**:  

This is a repository for my first Capstone Project as part of the Springboard's Data Science Career Track Program. More information about the project - including a description of the files - is below. 

**Problem Statement**:   
Home prices in Los Angeles County remain consistently high, which can make purchasing a home difficult for those unfamiliar with the market, the neighborhoods, or the popular home features in those neighborhoods (i.e. number of bedrooms, or proximity to a certain school district). Being able to predict home prices within the neighborhoods in the county would be a benefit to many. For example, for a first-time home buyer, the decision to put a bid on a home is a big one, and knowing early on whether or not a particular home is over-(or under-)valued would save them time, money, and stress. Additionally, this kind of information may be useful for a new home builder, as they assess the features that would be important to get the most value for their new build. In this project, I will look at a specific set of neighborhoods in the southwest corner of Los Angeles County, South Bay. I will look at home sales from the past two years in this area.
